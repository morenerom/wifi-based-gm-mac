This project is for Wi-Fi based GM-MAC protocol simulation.
--------------------------------------------------
Development Environment
* Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
* NS-3.29
--------------------------------------------------
Language
* C++
* Python
--------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0
* Group number initialization
- wifi-simple-adhoc.cc
- adhoc-wifi-mac
- wifi-mac-header

* Data transmission
- wifi-simple-adhoc
- adhoc-wifi-mac
- gm-data-header
- wifi-mac-header
- node

* Group number resetting when a sensor node can't receive CTS packet for 7 RTS
- adhoc-wifi-mac
- mac-low

* Sensor node sleep based on T-MAC protocol (610ms superframe, 15ms TA)
- adhoc-wifi-mac
- mac-low
- node
- wifi-mac-header

* etc
- wifi-helper
--------------------------------------------------
Version 1.1
* Sending data when the time frame starts ONCE
- adhoc-wifi-mac

* Clearing buffer when sender receives ACK packet for data
- mac-low
- wifi-mac-header

* If sensor node receives REQUEST packet from its parent node,
  it takes a sleep mode and starts to send REQUEST packet at the begin of next time frame
- adhoc-wifi-mac
--------------------------------------------------
Version 1.2
* If AdhocWifiMac::GetStateType() returns REQUEST, the sensor node doesn't reply REPLY packet
- adhoc-wifi-mac

* In Energy Model, I delete periodic update code and turning state to OFF code
- basic-energy-source
- wifi-radio-energy-model

* Periodic Resetting Group Number (every 1,000 time frame)
- adhoc-wifi-mac

* If a sensor node doesn't take any REPLY packets for REQUEST packet 4 times, it takes a sleep mode until next Periodic Resetting Group Number stage
- adhoc-wifi-mac

* Adding group number field in RTS packet. It allows the receiver to decide whether or not to reply the packet.
- wifi-mac-header
- mac-low

* [Update] Group number resetting -> If a sensor node dosen't take any REPLY packet for REQUEST packet, it starts to send REQUEST packet immediately not to send RTS first.
- adhoc-wifi-mac
--------------------------------------------------
Version 1.3
* [Update] Clearing Buffer when sender received ACK packet for data. I have to distinguish between ACK for DATA and ACK for REPLY. ONLY ACK for DATA makes the buffer clear.
- mac-low

* If sensor node can not set its group number and parent node during periodic resetting, it takes a sleep mode until next periodic resetting.
- adhoc-wifi-mac

* Error on WifiPhyStateHelper::SwitchToOff fixed.
